Game Overview:

The LRC game being a chance-based game doesn't really have a strategy of any sort, and is played simply with dice and chips. It's a very addicting, and fast-paced game that you surely would enjoy with a group of friends or with your family.

The three dice used in LRC aren't regular dice. Each die has 'L', 'R', and 'C' written on three sides, and three dots on the other three sides. However, the game can also be played using regular dice by previously deciding the sides that would denote each of the three letters. For instance, we could say the letter 'L' would be 1 on each die, 'C' would be 4, and 'R' would be denoted by 6. Another way could be using blank dice and marking L, R, and C on three sides, and dots on the rest.

Following are the rules for the game, so quickly go through them and begin playing LRC.

Rules:

Step 1
Gather 3 players.

Step 2
Each player begins with 3 coins. If playing a game rematch, previous winner goes first. Otherwise, oldest player goes first and is player1. Other players are determined by age as well, and assigned to player2 and player3 respectively. 

Step 3
Player1 rolls dice to begin playing.

Step 4
There could be four probable outcomes after the dice has been rolled. The dice could either show an L, R, C, or dots(x3).

If any of the dice turns up to be a dot, the player keeps a coin. If any of the dice turns up to be an L, the player gives a coin to the player on the left. If a dice turns out to be R, the player gives a coin to the player on your right. If any of the dice turns out to be a C, the player must place coin coin in the center.

Step 5
Now its player2's turn. Player2 rolls and keeps or passes their coins accordingly, followed by Player3's roll.

Step 6
Continue cycling through the players.  Players may only roll as many dice which correspond with the number of coins they have remaining. If you have one chip, roll one, and so on.

Step 7
If you are out of coins, you don't lose the game. There is a very high chance that a player besides you might give you a coin on his/her respective turn. However, you don't get to roll the die unless you have coins.

Step 8
The game continues untill a player is the only player with coins remaining. This player is the winner!

If you would like to play with money, each player should ante-up the same ammount prior to the game beginning. Winner take all!
